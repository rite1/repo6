Sharing customer testimonials is a great way to back up all your own claims about your product and establish credibility. What you may not have considered is how a testimonial is actually a customer’s little story.
An effective testimonial has the same structure as any great story. The main character (your customer) has a problem or obstacle, overcomes the obstacle (thanks to you), and lives happily ever after!

Company history
Sharing some of your company’s history is another simple way to engage customers through storytelling, especially for those in the B2B sector. Were your origins remarkable? Has your business been around for many years?
Any hurdles your company has faced, whether surviving a recession or shift in market can not only add interest to your story, but the struggle gives your customers something with which to relate. Maybe you have ground-level employees that carry inspiring stories of overcoming obstacles, and you can share how that represents your company’s values.
This is the kind of priceless content that connects potential customers to your brand.
